# Overview

I wanted to learn more about data analysis with python and answering questions based on data. It is interesting what one can learn from different dataset when we look through data and look at data in different ways.

I chose to research data on the titanic passengers and see what I could learn from the data. This dataset doesn't include all passengers and crew from the ship but does provide enough information to be usable. The dataset can be downloaded from this website [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset/data)

I have always been curious about ships and how humans have been ablee to explore the world via the oceans and seas of the world. The titanic disaster was a tragic event that claimed the lives of so many people and I have a deep respect for those who lost their lives that faitful night. I could feel the weight of the event as I asked questions about the events that transpired and imagined the devastation and the emotions of losing loved ones that night.

# Data Analysis Results

* What role did sex and passenger class actually play in survivability rates that night? It turns out that both sex and passenger class paid a significant role in survivability. Among females, members of the 1st and 2nd class passenger classes they survived both avobe 90%. While 3rd class females dropped down to about 50% survival rates. Males faired far worse which correlates to reports of only allowing women and children on life boats initially and launching them partially filled. 1st class males survived around 37%, however 2nd and 3rd class males both end up in the mid-teens range.

* Another question that came out of this dataset was whether having family on the ship correlated into these different groups survival rates? Based on the data, it is apparent that those who had family members aboard the ship were more likely to survive the disaster, but the difference between those with Family and those without wasn't nearly as drastic as sex and passenger class alone.

# Development Environment

I chose to use Microsoft's vscode editor with the python notebook extension for this project. 

I wrote the project using python with the pandas and matplotlib libraries.

# Future Work

* Export the graphics and results into a presentation to make the data more accessible to a larger audience.
* Obtain a more complete dataset that accounts for all passengers.
* I could research further if the males that did survive if they were children vs adults to further see how the data breaks down by age group.
